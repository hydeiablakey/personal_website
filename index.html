	<h2>Tech Skills</h2>
	<p>I have the basic knowledge of Python and Java programming languages through taking the courses at Lehman College. I've recently created a card game using Java programming, which you can view on my <a href="https://github.com/hydeiablakey/card-game.git" target ="_blank">github</a>, that allows you to draw a random card from the deck after shuffling the cards. 

	I am comfortable using the following software: Sublime Text, Eclipse, Microsoft Office Suite and Photoshop CS5 and CS6. And I am competent in using the following tools: Git, Bash.

	Lastly, I am currently learning how to use HTML, CSS and Javascript through self study.
